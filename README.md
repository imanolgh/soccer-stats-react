# Soccer Stats React
Welcome to my Soccer-Stats-React project repository. For this project, I recreated in React the Soccer_Standings_Site I originally coded in vanilla Javascript. In Soccer-Stats-React, I fetched data from the same API I used in the Soccer_Standings_Site project to display the standings for Europe's top 5 soccer leagues when you click on them. I plan on adding more features to this project, such as displaying the standings of the top-goalscorers, and perhaps other features that the API offers.
