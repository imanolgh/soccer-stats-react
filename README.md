# Soccer Stats React
Welcome to my Soccer-Stats-React project repository. In Soccer-Stats-React, I fetched data from this API: https://www.football-data.org/ to display the standings for Europe's top 5 soccer leagues when you click on their respective buttons. I plan on adding more features to this project, such as displaying the standings of the top-goalscorers for each league, and perhaps other features that the API offers.
